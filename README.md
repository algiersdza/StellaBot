# StellaBot

This project is based on my new language research programmed with Python and includes a user interface (tkinter) to help
manage the userâ€™s preferences, scrape a website for item availability capability and can output reports of 
findings in a csv format. 

With StellaBot, the user can run the application in the background for peace of mind and will 
be alerted if their specific item is available, and based on their preference, 
the application will place an order to purchase the item.

Supporting websites to be scraped will be a scrape sandbox to avoid IP bans and delays
of testing phase.
